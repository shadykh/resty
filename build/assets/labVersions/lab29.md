# LAB - Routing

**RESTy Phase 4:** Add routing and conditional rendering to RESTy


## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

> Continue working in your 'resty' repository, in a branch called 'composition'

## Business Requirements

Refer to the [RESTy System Overview](../../apps-and-libraries/resty/README.md) for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

## Phase 4 Requirements

In this final phase of the RESTy build, we will be adding some more fidelity to the application, including a menu with a ore detailed view of our history, as well as an about us page.

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I want to see all of my previous queries as a separate page so that I can browse them in greater detail
- As a user, I would like to view a separate "Help" page so I can learn how the application works

## Technical Requirements / Note

Update the RESTy application as follows:

- Add a menu bar to the header
  - Link labeled "Home" that links to '/' and shows the search form/results page
  - Link labeled "History" that links to '/history' and loads the history page
  - Link labeled "Help" that links to '/help' and loads the about us page

### Home Page

- Add a simple history list to the left side of the application
  - List all previous queries, showing the method and the URL
  - When a user clicks a previous query, populate the RESTy forms with the query information
- Completely hide the output area (Headers & Results) when there are none to display
- Display any fetch/load errors in place of the results area, if they occur
- Add a "Loading" indicator while fetching
  - When the user clicks the "Go!" button, show a loading icon on the page
  - When the fetching of results is complete, remove the loading icon and show the results

### History Page

- Maintain a list of every unique and successful API call the user has made
- On the History page, show a list of ever previous API call
  - Clicking on an entry shows the full details of that query in a separate section on the page
    - URL, Method, Body
    - Optionally, you can store other metadata about the query (time ran, bytes returned, etc) to show your users
  - Show a button labeled "Re-Run" that would execute that API call again and shows the home page with the form pre-filled

### Help Page
- Display static content detailing how a user should use the ReSTY application

### Application Architecture Notes

- Import `BrowserRouter` into your index, and wrap the `<App />` with it
- In the `<App />`, use routes to display the correct components, based on the route
- Create a new `<History/>` page component that will:
  - Show a list of URLs you've loaded before
  - Show full details of each search
  - Add a button to each to re-run the search
  - Redirect to the home page to show the results
- Create a new `<Help/>` page component that will:
  - Display static content to the users on how to use the application
